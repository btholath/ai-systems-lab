A **polynomial** is a type of mathematical expression made up of **variables**, **constants**, and **exponents**, combined using **addition, subtraction, and multiplication**—but never division by a variable or negative/fractional exponents.

### 🧮 Key Features of a Polynomial
- **Variables**: Like \( x \), \( y \), or \( z \)
- **Constants**: Numbers like 3, -7, or 0.5
- **Exponents**: Whole numbers only (e.g., \( x^2 \), not \( x^{-1} \) or \( \sqrt{x} \))
- **Operations allowed**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication

### ✅ Examples of Polynomials
- \( 3x^2 + 2x - 5 \)
- \( x^4 - 7x^2 + 1 \)
- \( 5 \) (yes, even a single number is a polynomial!)

### ❌ Not Polynomials
- \( \frac{1}{x} \) → division by a variable
- \( x^{-2} \) → negative exponent
- \( \sqrt{x} \) → fractional exponent

### 📚 Types by Number of Terms
| Type       | Example             |
|------------|---------------------|
| Monomial   | \( 4x^3 \)          |
| Binomial   | \( x^2 + 3x \)      |
| Trinomial  | \( x^2 + 3x + 2 \)  |

### 📏 Degree of a Polynomial
The **degree** is the highest exponent of the variable:
- \( 4x^3 - x + 2 \) → degree is 3

Polynomials are foundational in algebra and machine learning—especially in regression models like **polynomial regression**, where you fit curves to data using higher-degree terms.
