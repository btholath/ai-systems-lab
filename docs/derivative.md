Absolutely! Let’s break down how we calculate the derivative of this function:

### 🧮 The Function We're Working With
We’re starting with this:
```
f(x) = x³ - 5x + 7
```
This is a **polynomial**, which just means it’s made up of powers of x added or subtracted together.

### 🚀 What Is a Derivative?
Imagine you're riding a bike on a hill. The **derivative** tells you how steep the hill is at any point:
- If the slope is positive, you're going uphill.
- If it’s negative, you’re going downhill.
- If it’s zero, you’re on flat ground.

So when we take the derivative of a function, we’re asking:  
**“How fast is this function changing at any point?”**

### 🧠 Step-by-Step Derivative Rules

We’ll use these basic rules:
| Function Type | Derivative Rule |
|---------------|------------------|
| \( x^n \)      | \( n \cdot x^{n-1} \) |
| Constant × x  | Just the constant |
| Constant      | Derivative is 0 |

### ✏️ Apply the Rules to Each Term

Let’s go term by term:

#### 1. \( x^3 \)
- Rule: \( x^n \rightarrow n \cdot x^{n-1} \)
- So: \( \frac{d}{dx}(x^3) = 3x^2 \)

#### 2. \( -5x \)
- This is a constant times x.
- So: \( \frac{d}{dx}(-5x) = -5 \)

#### 3. \( +7 \)
- This is just a number (a constant).
- So: \( \frac{d}{dx}(7) = 0 \)

---

### ✅ Final Answer

Now we add up all the pieces:
```
f'(x) = 3x² - 5 + 0
       = 3x² - 5
```

### 🎯 Summary for Middle Schoolers

- You look at each part of the function.
- Use simple rules to find how each part changes.
- Add those changes together to get the full derivative.
